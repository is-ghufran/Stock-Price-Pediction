# Stock-Price-Pediction
üìà Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks (AAPL)
Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to forecast stock prices, specifically focusing on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Using historical stock data, we preprocess the dataset, normalize the input, and apply a Stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict future stock closing prices. The notebook is designed for execution in Google Colab, with optional integration to GitHub and Google Drive for persistent storage and version control.

üîç Problem Statement
Financial markets are influenced by various factors and are inherently volatile. Predicting stock prices with high accuracy is a non-trivial task. The goal of this project is to:

Use past stock prices to model and forecast future prices

Explore the suitability of LSTM networks for time-series forecasting

Analyze prediction accuracy through visualization and evaluation

üìä Dataset
Source: Tiingo / Yahoo Finance via pandas_datareader

Stock: AAPL (Apple Inc.)

Features Used: Primarily 'Close' prices

Time Range: Adjustable from January 2020 onward

Preprocessing:

Null-value checks

Feature selection (Close column)

Scaling using MinMaxScaler

üß† Model Architecture
A Stacked LSTM model was constructed using TensorFlow/Keras with the following configuration:

Input sequence length: 100 days

Layers:

3 LSTM layers with 50 units each

Dropout layers for regularization (optional)

Fully connected Dense layer as output

Loss Function: mean_squared_error

Optimizer: adam

Training split: 70% train, 30% test

üìà Evaluation Metrics & Results
Loss Curve: Tracked across epochs to observe convergence

Prediction vs. Actual Plot: Plots of real vs. predicted values

Scaling back: Predictions rescaled using the inverse transform of MinMaxScaler
